# github-repo-info-page
 A script that displays information about a GitHub repository, similar to Packagist


In the `func` folder, rename `config.example.php` into `config.php` and have fun.

The PHP script will cache the JSON data from your github repository for 12 hours. If you want to force a refresh, delete `data.json`
